Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe
1. I chose to overload the sellCoffee to only take the number of oz the coffee being ordered is. I did this because some people come into a coffee shop and just go medium coffee. Or want a black coffee. This method makes it easier for them to do that.
2. I chose to overload the constructor to just include a name, address, and number of stores. Brand new coffee shops start with new cups, coffee, sugar packets, and cream which all comes in default amounts so I figured if a coffee shop is new it will likley have these amounts of their stock. 

House
1. I chose to overload the constructor so you could easily make a default house with all default values. This is for if you want to test the methods.
2. I chose to overload the constructor so that the only parameter was name so if you only knew the name of the house you create the house. But with the name parameter you would at least have one unquie thing about the building.

Library
1. I made it so you could select if you wanted to print out the collection in a fancy format by putting fancy as a boolean parameter. 
2. I made a default constructor that only needs the libraries name so if you only knew the name of the library you could create a unquie library. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I tried to make it so that you could add multiple titles by the same name to the library but ran into issues because of the way a Hashtable is set up which taught me a lot. So I would say experiment but don't be afraid to give up on a method that doesn't work beacause you didn't fully understand how an element was set up. Also have fun with the methods, don't just overload the constructors its a fun challenge! Also I think this assignment went well.

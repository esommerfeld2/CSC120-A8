- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
Cafe
1. I chose to overload the sellCoffee to only take the number of oz the coffee being ordered is. I did this because some people come into a coffee shop and just go medium coffee. Or want a black coffee. This method makes it easier for them to do that.
2. I chose to overload the constructor to just include a name, address, and number of stores. Brand new coffee shops start with new cups, coffee, sugar packets, and cream which all comes in default amounts so I figured if a coffee shop is new it will likley have these amounts of their stock. 

House
1. I chose to overload the constructor so you could easily make a default house with all default values. This is for if you want to test the methods.
2. I chose to overload the constructor so that the only parameter was name so if you only knew the name of the house you create the house. But with the name parameter you would at least have one unquie thing about the building.

Library
1. When new books by a popular author come out libraries often buy multiple copies. I overloaded the addTitle method to include a parameter copies which allows you to add multiple copies of the same book at once. 
2. I made a default constructor that only needs the libraries name so if you only knew the name of the library you could create a unquie library. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
